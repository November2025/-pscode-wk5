// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

( a + b = c)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(( echo -n "Enter numnber : "
read number
 
remainder=$(( $number % 2 ))
 
if [ $remainder = 0 ]
then
  echo "$number is even number"
else
  echo "$number is odd number"
fi

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a-Write "please enter 5 numbers" Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5 

b-Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5 Write "The average is" Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 Write avg

c-If(n1 > n2) Set min to n2 Else Set min to n1 If(n3 < min) Set min to n3 If(n4 < min) Set min to n4 If(n5 < min) Set min to n5 Write "The min is" Write min

If(n1 < n2) Set max to n2 Else Set max to n1 If(n3 > max) Set max to n3 If(n4 > max) Set max to n4 If(n5 > max) Set max to n5 Write "The max is" Write max

d-Read n1,n2,n3,n4,n5 Write "The average is" Set avg to (n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5 Write avg

c-If(n1 > n2) Set min to n2 Else Set min to n1 If(n3 < min) Set min to n3 If(n4 < min) Set min to n4 If(n5 < min) Set min to n5 Write "The min is" Write min

If(n1 < n2) Set max to n2 Else Set max to n1 If(n3 > max) Set max to n3 If(n4 > max) Set max to n4 If(n5 > max) Set max to n5 Write "The max is" Write max
